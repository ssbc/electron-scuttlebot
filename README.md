## Features

It's better than email because:

 - Private messages are end-to-end encrypted, always.
 - You have to follow somebody to get messages from them, so you won't get spammed.
 - Your mail can be public broadcasts or private, and you'll only see replies by people you follow.
 - The datastructure is a global mesh of append-only logs, which can support new types of data (not just "mail").
 - Users are not bound to one server/host (what we call "pubs") and do not have to trust the servers.
 - It's very easy to setup and maintain your own pub.

It's better than twitter and facebook because:

 - Private messages are end-to-end encrypted, always.
 - The software runs on your device, so there's nobody tracking your browsing.
 - The application-code is FOSS, so you're free to fork or write new applications without a gatekeeper setting terms.
 - Data is saved to your disk, and so the application works offline.
 - You can sync directly with friends over the wifi.

## Pubs

In order to gossip outside your local network, you'll need to connect to a [Pub](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/concepts/pub.html).

You can find an invite to an available pub at the [Pub servers registry](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers).

Get an invite, then in `patchwork`: click "+ Join Pub" and paste the invite code.

This will cause you to follow the Pub and vise versa. If you haven't synchronized to this social network yet, prepare to wait a few minutes while your local server synchronizes.
