# Patchwork

**Patchwork is in active development. <a href="http://ssbc.github.io/">Sign up for our mailing list</a>, and we'll notify you when it's ready to use.**

Patchwork is a peer-to-peer network for sharing social feeds and open-source software. It gives you freedom to meet and collaborate online without surrendering ownership of your data.

Patchwork isn't a website: it runs on your computer and syncs over the Internet or WiFi. User-tracking and advertisements are actively prevented, and user applications are fully supported.
